            Before enrolling in Camosun, I completed my schooling at Pakistan International School in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where I studied from grade 5 through high school. During this time, I undertook both O-level and A-level studies under the Cambridge curriculum. This rigorous program, equivalent if not harder compare to the International Baccalaureate in Canada, provided a strong academic foundation and fostered a high level of discipline. I graduated in June 2023, equipped with the skills and resilience needed to succeed at camosun and beyond.
